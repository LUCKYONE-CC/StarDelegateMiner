# Start Delegate Miner
The Star Delegate Miner is a wrapper to simplify the mining process in combination with pooling. 

Thanks to the architecture offered by Star Delegate, pool handlers and miners can be easily derived and implemented from the respective base classes. 

The actual logic of the calculation should be outsourced to languages such as C++ or similar in order to mine as efficiently as possible. 

# Open to contribute
Everyone is welcome to expand Star Delegate and implement miners/pools accordingly. 

Miners/pools can be added via a pull request.

For other suggestions or errors, please create an issue.
